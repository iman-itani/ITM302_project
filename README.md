# ITM302 project: Database system 

Our database project for the healthcare center was built from scratch using SQL. 
It is designed to store and manage patient information, including medical histories, treatment plans, and payment information. 
The database also tracks appointments and schedules for both patients and staff. By centralizing this data and making it easily accessible,
we hope to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare center's operations.
Overall, the database is an essential tool for the healthcare center, and we believe it will greatly enhance the quality of care provided to our patients.
